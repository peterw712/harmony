STANDARD ROMAN NUMERAL NOTATION

1) SCALE DEGREE AND QUALITY
- Uppercase: major or augmented triads (I, IV, V)
- Lowercase: minor or diminished triads (ii, iii, vi)
- Diminished: "o" (viio, iio)
- Augmented: "+" (III+)

2) ACCIDENTALS
- Prefixes alter the scale degree relative to the key
- Example: bVII = lowered seventh scale degree
- Example: #iv = raised fourth scale degree

3) INVERSIONS (FIGURED BASS)
- Triads: root (no figure), first inversion (6), second inversion (6/4)
- Sevenths: root (7), first (6/5), second (4/3), third (4/2)

4) SEVENTH CHORD TYPES (AP-STYLE)
- 7 indicates a seventh chord; case shows triad quality.
- V7 = dominant seventh (major triad + minor seventh)
- IM7 = major seventh (major triad + major seventh)
- ii7 = minor seventh (minor triad + minor seventh)
- viiø7 = half-diminished seventh
- viio7 = fully diminished seventh

5) SECONDARY FUNCTION
- V/V = dominant of the dominant
- viio/V = leading-tone chord of the dominant
- The calculator treats secondary targets as major-key references.

6) MODAL MIXTURE
- Borrowed chords from the parallel major/minor
- Common examples in major: iv, bVI, bVII, bIII
- Common examples in minor: I, IV, V, bVI, bVII, bII

7) SPECIAL CHROMATIC SONORITIES
- Neapolitan: bII6 (typically in minor)
- Augmented sixths:
  - It+6: b6 - 1 - #4
  - Fr+6: b6 - 1 - 2 - #4
  - Ger+6: b6 - 1 - b3 - #4

INPUT TIPS
- Use sharps (#) and flats (b), e.g., V7, bVII, Ger+6.
- Roman numerals follow AP-style sevenths: ii7 (not iim7), IM7 for major seventh.
- Chord symbols support basic lead-sheet forms: C, Cm, Cdim, Caug, C7, Cm7, Cmaj7, Cm7b5.
